this is a program I made for me and my fiancé to watch movie files in a format similar to any streaming service 
it works nativity on rasberry pi 5 Trixie as that's where I devolved it
I do not know if it works on any other os

requirements 
-python
-Firefox
-VLC media player

to start the program type the Path to start.sh into a terminal
by default it runs on startup, this can be changed in the settings

I think it's fun
